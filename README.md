- Working on <a href="https://github.com/BoldBitcoinWallet/BBMTLib" target="_blank">Bold Bitcoin Wallet Library</a> AKA (the poor man's multi-sig warm wallet)
  
  - Developed for people who live where obtaining a hardware wallet isn't possible, but don't want to risk their bitcoin on a hot wallet.
  - Uses secure M-of-N <a href="https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib" target="_blank">multi-party computation threashold signature scheme</a>. 
  - All transactions appear on-chain as single-sig, which increases privacy and cheaper in fees than on-chain multi-sig.
  - Key generation and TX signing are transmitted via <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/44.md" target="_blank">NOSTR (NIP-44)</a>.
   
- I collaborate on various Bitcoin projects that I find useful like Utreexo, Floresta, and others.

- Currently coding in Go and Rust after being a .NET and Python dev for most of my career.
