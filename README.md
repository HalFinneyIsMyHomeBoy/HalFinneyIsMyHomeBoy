- Working on MPC TSS Bold Bitcoin Wallet - AKA (the poor man's multi-sig warm wallet)
  
  Developed for people who live in a place where they can't get a hold of a hardware wallet, but don't want to risk their bitcoin on a hot wallet.
  Uses M-of-N threashold signature scheme, but all transactions appear as single-sig, which increases privacy and cheaper than traditional multi-sig.
  Keygen and signing are done over NOSTR network.

- I collaborate on various Bitcoin projects that I find useful like Utreexo, Floresta, and others.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Go and Rust after being a .NET and Python dev most of my career.
- Quit my fiat job last year to pursue development in the Bitcoin space, never looking back and never been happier.
